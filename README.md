instAR brings augmented reality into life at the palm of your hands. With the use of an ARKit it uses the iPhoneâ€™s camera to analyze the surroundings around the user. When the camera detects a certain image, additional information is shown in the form of augmented reality. 

Built with Swift and ARKit.
